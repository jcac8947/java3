		1. Write a program that takes input from the user for principal amount, interest rate, and time period. The program should then calculate and display the simple interest.
		2. Develop a program that prompts the user to enter the simple interest, interest rate, and time period. The program should calculate and display the principal amount.
		3. Create a program where the user inputs the principal amount, interest rate, and simple interest. The program should compute and output the time period required for the investment to accrue the given simple interest.
		4. Build a program that takes input for principal amount, time period, and simple interest. The program should compute and display the rate of interest.
		5. Design a program where the user inputs the principal amount, interest rate, and time period. The program should calculate and display the maturity value, which is the sum of the principal and the simple interest.
